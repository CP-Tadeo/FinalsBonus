# FinalsBonus
Finals Bonus item

Like most other programs, there are multiple online compilers where you can run the code. 
Typically, I would suggest https://go.dev/play/ the golang.org's own golang online test ground, but it cannot
take in inputs. 
But I did make the bonus item using this online compiler instead:

The way the code works is first it will ask for a size - the number of items to sort. 
When the input is 0, it will set the value to 10. When the input is negative, the program panics and stops running. 
After that, you must input the values to sort. There are cues to keep track of the number of values. 
Then after that it will sort.
